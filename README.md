# Hi there! 👋 I'm Buğra,
I realized that software development could help me bring my thoughts and dreams to life. I chose web development as my career path because it is an important part of the software world. I am familiar with basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am actively developing my Frontend skills, and I plan to transition to a Full-stack developer role by developing my Backend skills.
